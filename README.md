# Pomodoro timer App
A python pomodoro app that helps you focus on your work.

## Features and used concepts:

    -GUI created using TKinter module
    -Time runs in separate thread and is not interrupted by other clicks/inputs/commands
    -Use of global variables within functions as a learning process

Features:
- Counts four focus rounds, each of 25 minutes
- Everytime a focus round ends, a 5-minute break starts 
- Tick gets added to visually represent progress after each round
- Reset/Start functionality
- Timer count formatted to look and behave like a usual clock (4:09 instead of 4:9)
- Dynamic text that displays current status (work, break, end)
